# About RRTMGP data

This directory contains data for use with the 
[RRTMGP k-distribution](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp) for computing 
absorption and scattering by gases in the the earth's atmosphere, as well an example implementation
of cloud optics and an implementation of aerosol optics following the MERRA aerosol description. 

The data have been copied and renamed from the 
[RRTMGP repository](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp)
at commit 74a0e09.
